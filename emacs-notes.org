** Happened on windows. Solution was to change the ~/.emacs.d/server directory ownership to your user, instead of the administrators group.  Security -> Advanced -> Ownership or something like that.

* Font notes

#+begin_src elisp
  (map 'string '(lambda (x) (insert (format "%s\n" x) )) (font-family-list))
#+end_src
